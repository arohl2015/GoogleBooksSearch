# Google Books React Search
For this week's assignment, our group was tasked with creating a new React-based Google Books Search app. This assignment required us to create React components, work with helper/utility functions, and utilize React lifecycle methods to query and display books based on user searches. We also used Node, Express and MongoDB so that users can save books to review or purchase later.

## Starting the app locally
Start by installing front and backend dependencies. While in this directory, run the following command:

```
npm install
```

This should install node modules within the server and the client folder. After both installations complete, run the following command in your terminal:

```
npm start
```

Your app should now be running on <http://localhost:3000>. The Express server should intercept any AJAX requests from the client.
